Install Sparkle with your package manager of choice:

<!-- Not published yet, but `sparkle-cli` wasn't taken. I would want `sparkle`, but it's taken (npm.im/sparkle).  -->

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: "NPM", value: "npm" },
    { label: "Yarn", value: "yarn" },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="npm">

    npm i sparkle-cli -g

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">
	  
	yarn global add sparkle-cli

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
